My presentation was about the Google File System. I did this project as it was an intering topic and something fun to learn more about. It was cool to learn about how the file system works since it is one of the most used systems in the world. It was also interesting to learn about the ways Google tried to keep its system simple by using simple machines, although a lot of them, to handle the incoming volume of requests.
